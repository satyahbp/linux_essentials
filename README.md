# linux_essentials
This repository will carry the commands required to execute when you install a new OS.
I'll go on updating this everytime I try a new linux.

If you don't find the repository you require, it means I haven't used it as my daily driver yet. Feel free to add it here.

## How to run the files?
This will mostly carry shell files, so you can look into them and try out the commands you want.

But if you want to run them directly, you have to make them executable first. 

To make the files executable, try the following steps: <br>
<ol>
<li>Go to the directory of the file you want to run</li>
<li>Make the file executable by running the command: <code>chmod +x {file_name}</code></li>
<li>Run the file using the command: <code>./{file_name}</code>
</ol>
